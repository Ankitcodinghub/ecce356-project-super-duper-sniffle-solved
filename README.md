Specifications and Requirements:

The goal of the project is to extend on the knowledge you gained in your assignments with regards to the basics of network programming within the TCP/IP Internet family environment, and its socket application programming interface (API) and also a little bit of multi-threading. You will use the TCP protocol as a ‚Äúdelivery service‚Äù, to carry your packets. The particular problem that you have to resolve consists of transferring Mail between multiple clients and one server logged in at different computers.

Scenario and Functionalities:

The project scenario is divided to 2 parts: basic scenario and advanced functionalities. The basic scenario extends on the scenario developed in assignment 2 and introduces additional components mentioned below. You are required to implement the complete basic scenario and at least one of the advanced features.

Basic scenario:

ÔÇ∑ Server: creates a directory for each registered client with ‚Äúinbox‚Äù and ‚Äúsent‚Äù directories in each.

o Directory title: clientemail

o Assume server already has a list of 5 existing emails.

ÔÇ∑ Client 1: constructs email to send to client 2 with an attachment.

o Attachment specifications: any type (pdf, word, png) and size more than 2 Mb. (i.e. email should be sent on multiple packets not only one)

ÔÇ∑ Client 1: connects to mail server

o Mail server name entered by client.

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Client 1: sends email to the server.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Server: saves the email to client 2‚Äôs ‚Äúinbox‚Äù directory.</li>
</ul>
o File name format: Subject_Time

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
ÔÇ∑ Server: saves email to the client 1‚Äôs ‚Äúsent‚Äù directory. o File name format: Subject_Time

ÔÇ∑ Client 2: connects to the mail server.

o Mail server name entered by client.

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Client 2: request updating local ‚Äúinbox‚Äù directory by the server.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Server: sends client 2 a copy of his ‚Äúinbox‚Äù directory.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Client 2: saves a copy of emails into the local inbox directory.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Client 1 and 2: list emails in their inbox/ sent directories.</li>
</ul>
o Format: From To Subject Timestamp. Advanced features:

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Multiple receivers: allow a sender to send an email to multiple receivers (multiple ‚Äúto‚Äù clients)</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Forward emails: a client can resend an existing email (from ‚Äúinbox‚Äù/ ‚Äúsent‚Äù) where the new email will be automatically constructed from the existing email.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Mark emails as read: once an email is read, a symbol should be added once listing the emails to indicate it was read
Assumptions and Specifications:
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;The server that clients connect to can change its name.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;If an attachment is sent along with an email it should be saved in the same directory as
the email with the same name. However, the extension (.png, .pdf) will be different.
</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;TO and FROM fields are email format and NOT host name</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Sender Client can send to different email IDs. (Do not restrict a single To and From
Emails)
</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;There should be input check aside from the server validation to ensure that the input
fields are valid.
</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;All the registered Clients‚Äô email addresses are stored in the mapping file on the server.
i.e. Server has to check the mapping file to acknowledge that the client is registered.
</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Any client can send and receive emails.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;All running codes should display its status (ex. Client print to screen, ‚Äúemail has been
sent to the server‚Äù, whenever it sends the email).
</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Server can receive emails to unconnected client and will forward them according to the
basic scenario once they connect.
</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Your program should include reply codes (error and confirmation) used in assignment 2.</li>
</ul>
